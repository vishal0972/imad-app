         Well the word SUCCESS means a lot to me. Today  i am looking at the past days and thinking what have i achieved and what not. The journey of life has been a real tough for me since so many years. Now i am 23 and i have to work hard and prove to myself that i can do it. No matter what huddle i come across. This blog begins with a word called success. So lets speak about success.
              SUCCESS can be defined in so many ways, but i want to name it in my own way, were in a living being wants to achieve in the life span. Every individual can give their own opinion about the word SUCCESS, but i am sure it would be entirely different among each individual. So said there are different ways to define SUCCESS. 
               The word GOAL is some or the other way related to the word SUCCESS if i am not wrong. Speaking about the common human being everyone wants to be a successful person. Come on now in the world there are three kinds of people. RICH, MIDDLE CLASS & POOR. But in these three categories i am sure every one would be thinking about this SUCCESS one or the other day, only because they want to achieve somethings in their life just for their personal satisfaction.
                Well coming to the point everyone might be thinking y i am speaking about SUCCESS in this way. So now let me tell you the story. This morning i and my friends were having a debate on the word called GREED. And while discussing this topic even SUCCESS was the topic in between this. Because earlier i have mentioned GOAL and even goal is a part of this SUCCESS. So let me come to the point. The discussion went around for an hour but was no end for the topic. So my point of view is to achieve SUCCESS every individual has to tackle so many things in their life. life is not easy that's what i feel now. The competition has begun long ago and to be a successful person you have to be strong enough to tackle all the things what so ever come across your way.
                 I felt to write this blog because so many people speak about SUCCESS but people from outside say that i am a successful person but they themselves know what they have left behind to achieve this success or may not.
                 Well lot more to discuss about this word but before that there is a Saying Life is a Race run for it. In the same way every one has to run for the success. life is not easy now a days and it has become more tougher than previous days.
                 This is what i feel about SUCCESS in short. So i will start running fast to be a successful person for myself. In short that should be my personal satisfaction.
